This resulted in out of memory crashes in dynamic worlds that loaded and unloaded parts of the scene. Crashes could also occurr if user logged into multiple heavy worlds with same Rocket instance. Thanks to Evocons employees for reporting the bug and providing scripts/assets to reproduce it.</li>
            <li><span class="fix">bugfix</span>Fix multiple minor memory leaks around the codebase. These are minor and should not trigger runtime crashes, but could culumate over time in certain scenarios to be significant.</li>
            <li><span class="fix">bugfix</span>Fix component crashes and performance issues when running in headless mode. In practise only affects headless server runs.</li>
            <li><span class="fix">bugfix</span>Make UTF8 characters work correctly to shell and UI console output.</li>

Removing entities was made a non blocking operation. In general the editor should not freeze anymore for long perioids of time. Tested to work smoothly in a +5000 Entity scene.

        <li><span class="enh">enhancement</span>Read 'heightmap' as 'normalmap' from Assimp if no real normalmap is set. This seems to be a common bug in exporters or a bug in Assimp itself.</li>

The API will ask for permission for a application before continuing, you can at any point deny or cancel the operation or providing file paths if you wish.</li>
